# Black Background

A [web application](http://black.edrini.xyz/) that has a black background. It's `body` background color is set to `#000`.

It also has a header titled **Black Background**, but since the text color is also black, its invisible.

### Possible Use

<li>Testing device screen</li>
<li>Situations where you want to/ have to stare at a black screen.</li>

<br/>

Press the `f11`(windows) or `ctrl`+`cmd`+`f`(mac) if you want it to be fullscreen.
